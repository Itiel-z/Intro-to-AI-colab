# Ethical AI: Fairness and Explainability in Income Prediction

This project explores **ethical machine learning** practices using the UCI Adult Income dataset. We build and evaluate a classification model while focusing on **fairness** (with respect to gender) and **explainability** using SHAP and LIME.

## Project Goals
- Train a machine learning model for income classification.
- Evaluate group fairness using metrics such as **selection rate**, **TPR**, and **FPR**.
- Apply explainability tools (SHAP & LIME) to interpret model behavior.
- Discuss ethical risks and potential bias mitigation strategies.

## Libraries Required
- Pandas and Numpy
- Matplotlip and Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Shap
- Lime
- Fairlearn
