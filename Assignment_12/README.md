# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Feedforward Neural Network

This project demonstrates image classification on the **CIFAR-10** dataset using a **simple feedforward neural network (FNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras. It illustrates the fundamental process of training deep learning models and comparing their capabilities with traditional machine learning approaches.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- **Model:** Feedforward Neural Network (Dense layers only)
- **Goal:** Classify 32x32 RGB images into 10 categories
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset Description

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of:
- 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
- 10 classes: `airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck`
- 50,000 training images, 10,000 test images
